With its symphonic Tschaikovsky score, Diamonds venerates the regality of Balanchine’s classical heritage.
Jewels, a work in three parts choreographed by George Balanchine, had a forerunner in the first production of Balanchine's Symphony in C at the Paris Opera in 1947. In it, each movement of the ballet, then called Le Palais de Cristal, was costumed in a different jewel color. After being inspired by a visit to famed jewelers Van Cleef and Arpels, Balanchine took up this concept again and selected emeralds, rubies, and diamonds for his parure, having also considered pearls and sapphires. But Jewels is really not so much about gems as about some facets of classical dancing, and while it has been considered the first three-act story-less ballet, the jewel motif, sustained by Karinska's costumes and the decor, is actually a device to unify sections that would otherwise be disparate; each act is quite distinct in style and has music by a different composer: Fauré for Emeralds, Stravinsky for Rubies, Tschaikovsky for Diamonds.","George Balanchine","2 hours 4 minutes","Emeralds: Pelléas et Mélisande (1898) and Shylock (1889) Rubies: Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra (1929) Diamonds: Symphony No. 3 in D major, Op. 29 (1875)","Gabriel Fauré, Igor Stravinsky, and Peter Ilyitch Tschaikovsky","April 13, 1967, New York City Ballet, New York State Theater","Emeralds: Violette Verdy, Mimi Paul, Sara Leland, Suki Schorer, Conrad Ludlow, Francisco Moncion, John Prinz; Rubies: Patricia McBride, Patricia Neary, Edward Villella; Diamonds: Suzanne Farrell, Jacques d'Amboise",12,"Karinska","Peter Harvey (original scenery, 1967), Robin Wagner (1983), Peter Harvey (2004)","Ronald Bates (original production); Mark Stanley (current production)","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1579693555/legacy/imported/jewels-key?_a=AACnOEz,","April 13, 1967","New York City Ballet, New York State Theater"

Western Symphony is a striking example of Balanchine’s fascination with American themes.

“The Unanswered Question” is the second section of Balanchine’s Ivesiana, which he choreographed to a series of unrelated Charles Ives orchestral pieces shortly after the composer’s death in 1954. The complex music of this Connecticut-born artist, incorporating extensive use of atonality, clashing meters and quarter-tones, had rarely been performed prior to its use in Ivesiana.

This sprightly music, despite its Italian air, was composed by Louis Moreau Gottschalk (1829-1869), a New Orleans­–born composer and pianist who made a large impact in his brief life. The audacity and wit of his works, along with his brilliance at the keyboard, made his compositions immensely popular — perhaps too popular, as he fell out of favor after his death, considered old-fashioned and clichéd. But Gottschalk was a true American original, and his achievements had a great impact on composers and performers who followed. Balanchine admired this particular composition and choreographed a pas de deux for Patricia McBride and Edward Villella — two virtuosic dancers — in 1964. In his Complete Stories of the Great Ballets, Balanchine wrote of the music, “It is a dazzling display piece, full of speed and high spirits. So, I hope, is the dance, which is ‘Neopolitan’ if you like and ‘demi-caractère.’ The costumes are inspired by Italy, anyhow, and there are tambourines.”","George Balanchine","8 minutes","Grand Tarentelle for Piano and Orchestra, Op. 67 (ca. 1866)","Louis Moreau Gottschalk, reconstructed and orchestrated by Hershy Kay","January 7, 1964, New York City Ballet, New York City Center of Music and Drama","Patricia McBride, Edward Villella",2,"Karinska","-","Mark Stanley (current production)","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_center,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1679429566/Ballets/Tarantella/FY24/Tarantella_BouderUlbricht_C31069-1?_a=AACnOEz,","January 7, 1964","New York City Ballet, New York City Center of Music and Drama"

For all its exuberant patriotic touches, Stars and Stripes contains as much pure dancing as many full-length classical ballets. The work is divided into five “campaigns,” each of which uses different themes from John Philip Sousa’s marches. When asked why he chose to choreograph a ballet to Sousa, Balanchine replied, “Because I like his music.” Stars and Stripes has been performed for many memorable occasions, including Nelson Rockefeller’s inauguration as governor of New York, tributes for Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, and the opening ceremonies for the New York State Theater (now the David H. Koch Theater) at Lincoln Center. The ballet is dedicated to the memory of Fiorello H.

Serenade is a milestone in the history of dance. It is the first original ballet George Balanchine created in America, and is one of the signature works of New York City Ballet’s repertory. Balanchine began the ballet as a lesson in stage technique and worked unexpected rehearsal events into the choreography; a student’s fall or late arrival to rehearsal became part of the ballet. After its initial performance by SAB students on June 9, 1934, on the grounds of the Warburg estate in White Plains, N.Y., Serenade was reworked several times. In its present form there are four movements: “Sonatina,” “Waltz,” “Russian Dance,” and “Elegy.” The last two movements reverse the order of Tschaikovsky’s score, ending the ballet on a note of sadness. Balanchine had a special affinity for Tschaikovsky. “In everything that I did to Tschaikovsky’s music,” he told an interviewer, “I sensed his help. It wasn’t real conversation. But when I was working and saw that something was coming of it, I felt that it was Tschaikovsky who had helped me.”","George Balanchine","32 minutes","Serenade for Strings in C, Op. 48 (1880)","Peter Ilyitch Tschaikovsky","March 1, 1935, American Ballet, Adelphi Theater, New York","Leda Anchutina, Holly Howard, Elise Reiman, Elena de Rivas, Sylvia Giselle (Gisella Caccialanza), Helen Leitch, Annabelle Lyon, Kathryn Mullowny, Heidi Vosseler, Charles Laskey, Ruthanna Boris",11,"Jean Lurçat (1935); Candido Portinari for American Ballet Caravan (1941); uncredited (1948); Karinska (1952)","Original scenery by Gaston Longchamp; performed without décor from 1941","Jean Rosenthal (1948); Ronald Bates (1964); Mark Stanley (current production)","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_south,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1590862592/Ballets/Serenade/Serenade_c39111-14?_a=AACnOEz,","March 1, 1935","American Ballet, Adelphi Theater, New York"

Orpheus occupies a singular place in the history of New York City Ballet.  The score was commissioned from Stravinsky by Ballet Society and the composer worked in close collaboration with Balanchine on the ballet – a contemporary treatment of the story of Orpheus, the musician-poet of Greek myth, and his struggle to rescue his wife Eurydice from Hades.  It was a performance of this work that led Morton Baum, chairman of the executive committee of the City Center of Music and Drama, to invite Ballet Society to become its permanent ballet company, under the new name, New York City Ballet.  Orpheus was presented with Concerto Barocco and Symphony in C at the New York City Ballet’s first performance on October 11, 1948.","George Balanchine","30 minutes","Orpheus (1947)","Igor Stravinsky","April 28, 1948, Ballet Society, City Center of Music and Drama, New York","Nicholas Magallanes, Francisco Moncion, Maria Tallchief, Beatrice Tompkins, Tanaquil Le Clercq, Herbert Bliss",6,"Isamu Noguchi","Isamu Noguchi","Jean Rosenthal (original production); Mark Stanley (current production)","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1605066617/Ballets/Orpheus/Orpheus-ReichlenLaCour-c45182-114-NCrop?_a=AACnOEz,","April 28, 1948","Ballet Society, City Center of Music and Drama, New York"

An intensive display of the classical ballet lexicon, Theme and Variations was intended, as Balanchine wrote, “to evoke that great period in classical dancing when Russian ballet flourished with the aid of Tschaikovsky’s music.” Set to the final movement of Tschaikovsky’s third orchestral suite, the score consists of a theme and 12 variations, culminating in a polonaise in the Imperial style. Arguably the most substantial part of the suite, Tschaikovsky himself began the concert tradition of playing this final movement as a separate piece. Balanchine created Theme and Variations in 1947 for Ballet Theatre (now American Ballet Theatre), and it briefly entered the NYCB repertory in 1960. In 1970 Balanchine used the complete orchestral suite to create Tschaikovsky Suite No. 3, and Theme and Variations, with a few minor revisions, returned to the repertory as the fourth and final movement of the ballet.","George Balanchine","21 minutes","Final movement of Suite No. 3 for orchestra in G major (1884)","Peter Ilyitch Tschaikovsky","September 27, 1947, Ballet Theater, Richmond, Virginia","Alicia Alonso, Igor Youskevitch",2,"Karinska (from Symphony in C)","-","David Hays","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1579781836/legacy/imported/theme-and-variations-key?_a=AACnOEz,","September 27, 1947","Ballet Theater, Richmond, Virginia"

Apollo is the oldest Balanchine ballet in New York City Ballet’s repertory. Created for Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, and originally titled Apollon Musagète, the ballet premiered in Paris in 1928 and was Balanchine’s first major collaboration with composer Igor Stravinsky. With this dramatic and powerful ballet, which created a sensation when it was first performed, the 24-year-old Balanchine achieved international recognition. The 1928 premiere of the ballet featured sets and costumes by the French painter André Bauchant and in 1929 new costumes were created by Coco Chanel. The ballet was first performed by New York City Ballet in 1951, and during his lifetime Balanchine continued to revise the work, eliminating sets, costumes, and much of the ballet’s narrative content.","George Balanchine","28 minutes","Apollon Musagète (1928)","Igor Stravinsky","June 12, 1928, Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, Paris","Alice Nikitina, Lubov Tchernicheva, Felia Doubrovska, Serge Lifar",4,"André Bauchant, executed by Prince A.

Balanchine choreographed this work (then called Night Shadow) in 1946, for Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, featuring Alexandra Danilova, Nicholas Magallanes, and Maria Tallchief. He used music by Vittorio Rieti based on themes from several of Vincenzo Bellini’s operas. The ballet was first performed by New York City Ballet in 1960, with Allegra Kent, Erik Bruhn, and Jillana in the lead roles.
Set at a masked ball, the one-act La Sonnambula tells the story of a Coquette, a Poet, and a beautiful Sleepwalker. The story remains mysterious, inviting different interpretations of the characters’ actions and relationships; it is the moods and emotions evoked by Balanchine’s choreography that give the ballet its resonance. Its atmosphere of sinister menace brings to mind 19th-century Romantic ballets like Giselle and La Sylphide, with their haunting stories of doomed love.","George Balanchine, staged by John Taras","31 minutes","Based on themes from operas by Vincenzo Bellini, including La Sonnambula, Il Puritani, Norma and I Capuleti e i Montecchi (1830-1835)","Vittorio Rieti","February 27, 1946, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, City Center of Music and Drama, New York","Alexandra Danilova, Nicholas Magallanes, Maria Tallchief, Michel Katcharoff",4,"André Levasseur (Alain Vaes, 1987)","Esteban Francés (Alain Vaes, 1987)","Esteban Francés (Mark Stanley, 1987)","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1589845165/Ballets/Sonnambula-La/Sonnambula-Hyltin-C36663-5?_a=AACnOEz,","February 27, 1946","Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, City Center of Music and Drama, New York"

Balanchine first staged Tschaikovsky’s Second Piano Concerto for the American Ballet Caravan in May 1941. Under the sponsorship of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs under the Roosevelt administration (Nelson A. Rockefeller, coordinator), the Caravan undertook a tour of South America, performing in every country except Paraguay and Bolivia.
It was felt that a classical ballet should be presented, but instead of reviving an existing ballet, Balanchine created a work in the style of Petipa and the Petersburg tradition. The decor, by Mstislav Dobuzhinsky, showed the Neva, with the Peter-Paul Fortress, framed in the Imperial blue and white of the Winter Palace.
Ballet Imperial was revived in 1964 by New York City Ballet with new decor by Rouben Ter-Arutunian, who followed a similar visual approach. In 1973, Balanchine felt that the allusion to Imperial Russia was outmoded, and that the ballet could stand in relation to the music alone. The title was changed, the decor eliminated, the costumes simplified, and some of the pantomime in the second movement altered—but the choreography as a whole remained the same.

Concerto Barocco had its beginnings as a School of American Ballet exercise and was first performed for the Latin American tour of the American Ballet Caravan in 1941. When it entered the repertory of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1945, the dancers were dressed in practice clothes, probably the first appearance of what has come to be regarded as the modern ballet costume pioneered by Balanchine.
Concerto Barocco was presented on the first performance of New York City Ballet in 1948, along with Balanchine's Orpheus and Symphony in C. It is considered the quintessential Balanchine ballet of its period, its manner entirely pure, its choreography no more, and no less, than an ideal response to its score, Bach's Double Violin Concerto in D Minor.

Georges Bizet composed his Symphony in C Major when he was a 17-year-old pupil of Charles Gounod at the Paris Conservatory. The manuscript was lost for decades and was published only after it was discovered in the Conservatory’s library in 1933.
Balanchine first learned of the long-vanished score from Stravinsky. He required only two weeks to choreograph it as Le Palais de Cristal for the Paris Opera Ballet in 1947, where he was serving as a guest ballet master. When he revived the work the following year for New York City Ballet’s first program on October 11, 1948, he simplified the sets and costumes and changed the title. The ballet has remained a vital part of the Company’s repertory ever since.

"Who-Cares?-excerpts","Gershwin’s radiant melodies serve as the basis for syncopated group dances and balmy, romantic duets.","Gershwin’s radiant melodies serve as the basis for syncopated group dances and balmy, romantic duets.
Balanchine had an early opportunity to work with George Gershwin: In 1937 Gershwin asked Balanchine to come to Hollywood to work with him on Goldwyn’s Follies(released 1938), which included a Romeo and Juliet number with a mock duel between ballet-dancing Montagues and tap-dancing Capulets. Thirty-three years later, Balanchine choreographed Who Cares? to 16 songs Gershwin composed between 1924 and 1931. Balanchine used the songs not to evoke a particular era but as a basis for a dynamic that is uniquely American and, more specifically, evocative of New York City: Balanchine’s choreography brings out the exuberance of city life.
Who Cares? is both the name of a ballet in the classical idiom by George Balanchine and an old song George and Ira Gershwin wrote in 1931 for Of Thee I Sing. The dictionary says “classic” means standard, leading, belonging to the highest rank or authority. Once it applied mainly to masterpieces from Greco-Roman antiquity; now we have boxing and horse-racing classics, classic cocktail-dresses, and classic cocktails. Among classic American composers we number Stephen Foster, John Philip Sousa, and George Gershwin (1898-1937). First heard 50 years ago, the best of Gershwin songs maintain their classic freshness, like an eternal martini – dry, frank, refreshing, tailor-made, with an invisible kick from its slightest hint of citron. Nostalgia has not syruped the songs’ sentiment nor robbed them of immediate piquancy. We associate them with time past, but when well sung or played, or preferably both at once, they not only revive but transcend their epoch.
The Gershwins’ beautiful manners and high style, their instant melange of insouciance and shrewd innocence, their just estimation of the imaginative elasticity of an elite audience that they had developed, have left a body of words and music that lives unblurred by vulgar rhetoric or machine-made sentiment. To combine an intensely personal attitude with a flagrantly popular language is a feat that few popular artists manage, and it is appropriate that Balanchine has used the songs not as facile recapitulation of a lost epoch, but simply as songs or melodies for classic, undeformed, traditional academic dances, which in their equivalence of phrasing, dynamics, and emotions find their brotherly parallel.

Although Philip Glass’s work is often labeled as minimalist, he prefers to call it “music with repetitive structures.” His early compositions were greatly influenced by Ravi Shankar and the hypnotic rhythms of Indian music. Some of his most notable work for theater includes the trilogy of operas comprising Einstein on the Beach, Satyagraha, and Akhnaten.Jerome Robbins, originally in line to direct Akhnaten, instead choreographed a ballet using music from the opera along with Rubric and Facades, both from Glassworks. In Glass Pieces, Robbins incorporated concepts from postmodern dance into the traditional ballet vocabulary, and he infused the work with a distinctly urban energy. The recurrent rhythms, driving momentum, and labyrinth of shifting patterns of the ensemble combine to create a physical architecture for Glass’s music.","Jerome Robbins","24 minutes","Rubric and Façades from Glassworks, excerpts from the opera Akhnaten","Philip Glass","May 12, 1983, New York City Ballet, New York State Theater","Heléne Alexopoulos, Peter Frame, Lourdes Lopez, Joseph Duell, Lisa Hess, Victor Castelli, Maria Calegari, Bart Cook",8,"Ben Benson","Jerome Robbins and Ronald Bates (Production Design)","Ronald Bates","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1590869681/Ballets/Glass-Pieces/GlassPieces_c35827-3?_a=AACnOEz,","May 12, 1983","New York City Ballet, New York State Theater"

Balanchine had admired Chabrier's music since discovering it after leaving Russia during his early years in France. He knew well the pieces he would assemble into the score of Bourrée Fantasque, but waited a long time before he used them to create one of the first works for the newly-formed New York City Ballet.
Balanchine was well-known for his wonderful wit as well as an encyclopedic knowledge of dance forms. Here he takes comic aim at many of the conventions that typify the classical dance while providing glimpses of such popular dances such as the can-can and tango. This large ballet for 42 dancers is performed in four movements with each of the first three sections having its own principal couple and culminates in a rousing finale for the entire cast. Critics have cited Bourrée Fantasque for its Gallic style, Russian dance vocabulary and American dynamism.","George Balanchine","23 minutes","Marche Joyeuse (1888); Bourrée Fantasque (1891); ""Prélude"" from the opera Gwendoline (1885); ""Féte Polonaise"" from the comic opera Le Roi Malgré Lui (The Reluctant King) (1887)","Emmanuel Chabrier","December 1, 1949, New York City Ballet, City Center of Music and Drama","Tanaquil Le Clercq, Jerome Robbins, Maria Tallchief, Nicholas Magallanes, Janet Reed, Herbert Bliss",6,"Karinska","-","Jean Rosenthal","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_center,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1714076998/Ballets/BOURR%C3%89E%20FANTASQUE/BourreeFantasque-KiktaMejiaEVonEnckVillarini-Velez-230929-102?_a=AACnOEz,","December 1, 1949","New York City Ballet, City Center of Music and Drama"

The original Slaughter on Tenth Avenue was created for the 1936 Rodgers and Hart musical On Your Toes, and featured Ray Bolger as ""The Hoofer"" and Tamara Geva as ""The Stripper."" The first full-scale ballet within a musical, and the first to advance the action of the show, it also introduced the word ""choreography"" to Broadway, at Balanchine's request. On Your Toes was also the first of four Rodgers and Hart musicals choreographed by Balanchine during the 1930s, the others being Babes in Arms, I Married an Angel, and The Boys from Syracuse.
A story-within-a-story, it tells the tale of a jealous premier danseur, who hires a thug to kill a rival during the premiere of a new ballet. The ballet — Slaughter on Tenth Avenue — concerns the seedy denizens who patronize a strip joint near the New York waterfront where brawls frequently occur. Within the context of this shabby setting, a Hoofer falls in love with a Stripper and is discovered with her after closing time by the club's owner, the Big Boss, who accidentally shoots her. The ""corpse"" of the Stripper manages to pass a note to the Hoofer warning him of the real murder plot, and once aware that the thug, who is sitting in one of the theater's boxes, is planning to shoot him when he stops dancing, the Hoofer keeps repeating his closing phrase until the police arrive.","George Balanchine","27 minutes","From On Your Toes (1936)","Richard Rodgers, orchestrated by Hershy Kay","April 11, 1936, from On Your Toes, Imperial Theater","Suzanne Farrell, Arthur Mitchell",2,"Irene Sharaff","Jo Mielziner","Jo Mielziner; later by Ronald Bates (original production); Mark Stanley (current production)","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_center,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1590862647/Ballets/Slaughter-on-Tenth-Avenue/Slaughter-Kowroski-c18203-06?_a=AACnOEz,","April 11, 1936","from On Your Toes, Imperial Theater"

Serge Diaghilev, who founded Ballets Russes in 1911, was a ballet and opera impresario who brought together the best of new music, dance, and visual art in his productions. George Balanchine was hired by Diaghilev in 1924 and created several ballets before the company disbanded in 1929, after Diaghilev's sudden death.
Prodigal Son was the last of Balanchine's works for Ballets Russes; it premiered in 1929, opening what was to be the company's final Paris season. Diaghilev commissioned Sergei Prokofiev to write the score and Georges Rouault to design the Fauvist sets and costumes. The ballet's story comes from the biblical parable, but Boris Kochno added much dramatic material and, to emphasize the themes of sin and redemption, ended the story with the Prodigal's return home.
Prodigal Son was enthusiastically received by both audience and critics and was one of Balanchine's first ballets to achieve an international reputation. Its eternal themes, expressive score, and abstract but thoroughly dramatic movement make it as modern, exciting, and powerful today as it was in 1929.","George Balanchine","35 minutes","Le Fils Prodigue Op. 46 (1928-29), libretto by Boris Kochno.","Sergei Prokofiev","May 21, 1929, Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt, Paris","Felia Doubrovska, Serge Lifar, Michael Fedorov, Eleanora Marra, Nathalie Branitzka, Léon Woizikowsky, Anton Dolin",7,"Recreated by Esteban Francés from sketches by Georges Rouault","Recreated by Esteban Francés from sketches by Georges Rouault (added July 1950)","Ronald Bates (original production); Mark Stanley (current production)","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1590862066/Editorial/Spotlight-on-Prodigal-Son/ProdigalSon_UlbrichtReichlen_c31685-15?_a=AACnOEz,","May 21, 1929","Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt, Paris"

The Steadfast Tin Soldier, based loosely on a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, focuses on the wistful courtship and love between a tin soldier and a paper-doll ballerina. The work was commissioned by the Saratoga Performing Arts Center.
The present pas de deux stems from a 1955 collaboration in which Balanchine, Francisco Moncion, and Barbara Milberg choreographed all of Bizet's Jeux d'Enfants. Both the context and the woman's variation of The Steadfast Tin Soldier were derived from this earlier work.

Balanchine created this work for the 1975 Ravel Festival, and it was choreographed for the legendary ballerina Suzanne Farrell. Originally titled Tzigane, after the name of Maurice Ravel’s rhapsodic score, the ballet was revived by NYCB for the first time in more than 30 years with a new name – Errante. In Ravel’s time, Tzigane did not strictly refer to the Roma people, but now it carries negative meanings. After consulting with Farrell, The George Balanchine Trust, and NYCB, the name of the ballet was changed. Farrell, holding the rights, adopted Errante, meaning wandering, a title Balanchine once used for a 1933, now lost ballet.","George Balanchine","11 minutes","Tzigane (1924)","Maurice Ravel","May 29, 1975, New York City Ballet, Ravel Festival, New York State Theater","Suzanne Farrell, Peter Martins",2,"Joe Eula and Stanley Simmons (from Kodály Dances)","-","Ronald Bates","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1714426852/240423-265Errante?_a=AACnOEz,","May 29, 1975","New York City Ballet, Ravel Festival, New York State Theater"

Igor Stravinsky composed his three-movement Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra, the music for Rubies, in 1928-29. He intended it as a vehicle for his own appearances as a concert pianist and as something of a relief from his Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments, which he had written five years before for the same purpose. The Capriccio is, in effect, a second piano concerto. Stravinsky said that as he wrote this score he had in mind Carl Maria von Weber, a composer he championed; in fact, he quotes Weber in the music. Another of Stravinsky’s enthusiasms that affects the Capriccio is the cimbalom. Figurations typical of this east European instrument are in evidence at various places in the solo piano part — in certain repeated notes and in the cadenza in the second movement, for example. Balanchine set the second movement as a pas de deux for the principal dancers, and they and a soloist dance with the corps de ballet in various combinations in the outer movements.","George Balanchine","19 minutes","Rubies: Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra (1929)","Igor Stravinsky","April 13, 1967, New York City Ballet, New York State Theater","Patricia McBride, Patricia Neary, Edward Villella",3,"-","-","-","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_north,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1590862317/Ballets/Jewels/Rubies/Rubies-Kikta-190917B-199?_a=AACnOEz,","April 13, 1967","New York City Ballet, New York State Theater"

Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night's Dream is one of his happiest and most loved comedies. It is called a ""Dream"" because of the unrealistic events the characters experience in the play — real, yet unreal, such as crossed lovers, meaningless quarrels, forest chases leading to more confusion, and magic spells woven by the infamous Puck. Balanchine had been familiar with Shakespeare’s play from an early age. As a child he had appeared as an elf in a production in St. Petersburg, and he could recite portions of the play by heart in Russian. Balanchine loved Mendelssohn’s overture and incidental music for A Midsummer Night’s Dream (composed over a period of 15 years with the overture (Opus 21) first in 1826, and the other sections later in Opus 61). It is this score, Balanchine later said, that inspired his choreography. Mendelssohn had written only about an hour’s worth of music for the play, not enough for an evening-length dance work, so Balanchine added the following pieces, listed in the order of being played: Overture to Athalie, Opus 74; Overture to The Fair Melusine, Opus 32; excerpts from The First Walpurgis Night, Opus 60; Symphony No. 9 for Strings; Overture to Son and Stranger, Opus 89.Midsummer night has long been associated with love and magic. In European folklore it is the one night of the year when supernatural beings such as fairies are about and can interact with the real world. It is also a date that falls near the summer solstice, which was traditionally a time for fertility rites and festivals devoted to love. Shakespeare’s 1595 play has been the source for films, an opera by Benjamin Britten (1960), and a one-act ballet by Frederick Ashton, called The Dream (1964). George Balanchine’s version, which premiered in 1962, was the first wholly original evening-length ballet he choreographed in America. Two years later, on April 24, A Midsummer Night’s Dream opened the New York City Ballet’s first repertory season at the New York State Theater (now the David H. Koch Theater).","George Balanchine","Act I: 1 hour 8 minutes, Act II: 32 minutes","Overture and Incidental Music to A Midsummer Night's Dream, opp. 21 and 61 (1826, 1842); Overtures to Athalie, op. 74 (1845), The Fair Melusine op. 32 (1833), The First Walpurgis Night, op. 60; Symphony No. 9 for strings; Overture to Son and Stranger, op. 89 (1829)","Felix Mendelssohn","January 17, 1962, New York City Ballet, City Center of Music and Drama","Suki Schorer, Arthur Mitchell, Jillana, Edward Villella, Melissa Hayden, Conrad Ludlow, Roland Vazquez, Francisco Moncion, Patricia McBride, Nicholas Magallanes, Bill Carter, Gloria Govrin, Violette Verdy",13,"-","-","-","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_center,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1590869904/Ballets/Midsummer-Nights-Dream-A/Midsummer_Ball_c41877-8-CROP-OUT-FAIRY-FAR-RIGHT?_a=AACnOEz,","January 17, 1962","New York City Ballet, City Center of Music and Drama"

Dances at a Gathering, which premiered in 1969, heralded Jerome Robbins’ return to New York City Ballet after a 13-year absence. Inspired by Chopin’s piano music, Robbins quickly began choreographing in the rehearsal studio. When he showed 25 minutes of choreography to Balanchine, he said, “Make more, make it like popcorn,” pretending to pop popcorn into his mouth. The work eventually expanded to an hour in length with a cast of ten dancers.
Chopin’s mazurkas, waltzes, and études, groundbreaking at the time of their composition, are rooted in the Slavic character of his Polish homeland, yet still convey the elegance of Paris, where they were created. Robbins ultimately used 18 of Chopin’s piano pieces, creating dances for various duets, solos, and larger groupings. “The ballet stays and exists in the time of the music and its work,” wrote Robbins. “Nothing is out of it, I believe; all gestures and moods, steps, etc. are part of the fabric of the music’s time and its meaning to me.”","Jerome Robbins","60 minutes","Mazurka, op. 63, no. 3; Waltz, op. 69, no. 2; Mazurka, op. 33, no. 3; Mazurkas, op. 6, nos. 2 and 4, op. 7, nos. 4 and 5, op. 24, no. 2; Waltz, op. 24; Waltz, op. 34, no. 2; Mazurka, op. 56, no. 2; Etude, op. 25, no. 4; Waltz, op. 34, no. 1; Waltz, op. 70, no. 2; Etude, op. 25, no. 5; Etude, op. 10, no. 2; Scherzo, op. 20, no. 1; Nocturne, op. 15, no. 1","Frédéric Chopin","May 22, 1969, New York City Ballet, New York State Theater","Allegra Kent, Sara Leland, Kay Mazzo, Patricia McBride, Violette Verdy, Anthony Blum, John Clifford, Robert Maiorano, John Prinz, Edward Villella",10,"Joe Eula","-","Jennifer Tipton","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_center,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1593286309/Uploads/dances-at-a-gathering-key?_a=AACnOEz,","May 22, 1969","New York City Ballet, New York State Theater"

Johannes Brahms’ Piano Quartet in G minor, Op. 25 (1861) marked a new development in chamber music. Though it received mixed reviews at the time of its premiere, it proved to be deeply influential for a number of 20th-century composers, laying the groundwork for atonality. 
Among the work’s admirers was Brahms’ great Viennese successor, Arnold Schoenberg, who in 1937 arranged the quartet for orchestra. In a letter to Dr. Alfred Frankenstein, the distinguished critic and musicologist of the San Francisco Chronicle, Schoenberg gives his reasons for this somewhat surprising undertaking: “1. I love the piece. 2. It is seldom played. 3. It is always very badly played, as the better the pianist, the louder he plays, and one hears nothing of the strings. I wanted for once to hear everything, and this I have achieved.”
Balanchine often visited Stravinsky in Hollywood, and the composer would make suggestions of unfamiliar scores that might be suitable for ballet. In 1957, he played Balanchine a version of the Gounod Symphony, which the choreographer set the following year. In 1964, similarly, came the suggestion of Schoenberg’s orchestration of Brahms’ quartet, and Balanchine premiered the ballet in 1966, two years after NYCB’s move from City Center to the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center.","George Balanchine","43 minutes","Piano Quartet No. 1 in G minor, Op. 25 (1861), orchestrated by Arnold Schoenberg (1937)","Johannes Brahms","April 12, 1966, New York City Ballet, New York State Theater","Melissa Hayden, Gloria Govrin, Patricia McBride, Allegra Kent, Suzanne Farrell, André Prokovsky, Conrad Ludlow, Edward Villella, Jacques d'Amboise",9,"-","-","-","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1580989439/Uploads/brahms-schoenberg-quartet-key?_a=AACnOEz,","April 12, 1966","New York City Ballet, New York State Theater"

Interplay was the second ballet that Jerome Robbins choreographed, after his huge success with Fancy Free. It debuted in 1945 for Billy Rose's Concert Varieties at the Ziegfeld Theater and entered the New York City Ballet repertory in 1952. Using the interplay of classical and vernacular choreography, Robbins experimented with choreographic patterns and the interactions of dancers in various formations. Originally titled American Concertette, Morton Gould's score, full of humor and jazzy orchestration, revels in the swingtime rhythms of the 1940s.

Jerome Robbins was a great admirer of the Russian stars Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov, who each famously defected and made new careers in America. Other Dances, a pas de deux created in 1976 for a New York Public Library for the Performing Arts benefit, was specifically crafted to display their legendary technique and artistry.
Robbins chose four mazurkas and one waltz by Chopin, the composer whose piano music had inspired him for Dances at a Gathering. Although Chopin did not invent the mazurka, a stylized Polish dance in triple meter, his compositions brought them to the public attention and raised them to a new level of sophistication.

Christopher Wheeldon's second work for New York City Ballet, Scènes de Ballet, is set in a Russian ballet studio (designed by Ian Falconer), a slightly skewed classroom bisected by a barre and an imaginary mirror. The dancers — 64 School of American Ballet students ranging from the very young to the soon-to-graduate — are similarly divided between ""real"" dancers and their ""reflections."" This classically inspired ballet displays what one critic has called ""a bracingly confident fusion of George Balanchine's structured clarity with the sunny lyricism of Frederick Ashton.""   Stravinsky said his music for Scènes de Ballet was free of any literary or dramatic intentions and that ""the parts follow each other as in a sonata or in a symphony in contrasts and similarities."" He did, however, specify different dances for the 11 parts of his score. Stravinsky, who was living in Hollywood at the time, originally wrote Scènes de Ballet for a review called ""The Seven Lively Arts,"" presented by showman Billy Rose at the Ziegfield Theatre in New York City on December 7, 1944. The leading roles were danced by Anton Dolin (who had choreographed the piece) and Alicia Markova. Since then, the score has been used by a number of choreographers, including John Taras (for New York City Ballet's 1972 Stravinsky Festival) and Frederick Ashton who, in 1948, created a ballet for Margot Fonteyn, Michael Somes and a corps de ballet.","Christopher Wheeldon","19 minutes","Scènes de Ballet (1944)","Igor Stravinsky","May 19, 1999, New York City Ballet, New York State Theater","Students from the School of American Ballet",1,"Holly Hynes","Ian Falconer","Mark Stanley","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_south,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1679429275/Ballets/Scenes-de-Ballet/FY24/ScenesdeBallet-c22191-2?_a=AACnOEz,","May 19, 1999","New York City Ballet, New York State Theater"

For New York City Ballet’s 1972 Stravinsky Festival, Balanchine choreographed several notable masterpieces, including the majestic Symphony in Three Movements.  Stravinsky had suggested the music as a ballet when the choreographer visited the composer in Hollywood during World War II. Despite its 21 minute length, the piece evokes a fuller symphonic breadth with two instruments, the harp and piano, providing the dominant contrasts. “Each instrument has a large obbligato role in a movement to itself, and only at the turning- point fugue…do the two play together and unaccompanied,” said Stravinsky. The signature Stravinsky propulsive rhythm is mirrored by the angular, athletic choreography for soloists and a large ensemble, although the second andante movement, originally composed for an apparition scene in the movie Song of Bernadette, is reserved for a meditative pas de deux.

In 1944, Jerome Robbins — then a young dancer with Ballet Theatre (now American Ballet Theatre)— choreographed his first ballet, a collaboration with up-and-coming composer Leonard Bernstein. The two wanted to bring a modern American sensibility to ballet, and they hit on the perfect concept: sailors on shore leave in New York City, a common sight in those days. The premiere performance of Fancy Free has become legendary, with two dozen curtain calls for the stunned cast, composer, and choreographer, and raves from the bowled-over critics.
Fancy Free was the inspiration for a full-length musical, On the Town, that was also a great success, and Robbins and Bernstein went on to collaborate on another Broadway classic, West Side Story. Of course, each man had many subsequent successes; Bernstein became the music director of the New York Philharmonic and a prolific composer and conductor, and Robbins was the creative force behind many enduring Broadway hits, as well as the choreographer of some of New York City Ballet’s core works. But it was Fancy Free that put Robbins on the map as someone who had a clear eye for creating compelling movement, a deft hand at telling a story, and a creative vision that was unique in the world of theater.","Jerome Robbins","29 minutes","Fancy Free (1944)","Leonard Bernstein","April 18, 1944, by Ballet Theatre (now American Ballet Theatre), Metropolitan Opera House, New York","John Kriza, Harold Lang, Jerome Robbins, Muriel Bentley, Janet Reed, Shirley Eckl",6,"Kermit Love","Oliver Smith","Ronald Bates","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1595628078/Ballets/Fancy-Free/FancyFree_MejiaCollVillariniMaxwell_c44847-14_NCrop?_a=AACnOEz,","April 18, 1944","by Ballet Theatre (now American Ballet Theatre), Metropolitan Opera House, New York"

After the enormous popularity of Dances at a Gathering in 1969, Jerome Robbins built on his love affair with Chopin’s piano works with In the Night.  While the earlier ballet primarily uses mazurkas, waltzes, and études, In the Night, which premiered in 1970, conjures up a post-dusk scenario to four of the composer’s nocturnes. Choreographed for three couples of distinct personality, the ballet uses the music as a jumping-off point to explore subtle dance dramas.

When opera was presented in Paris in the late nineteenth century, the composer was obliged to include a ballet at the beginning of the third act, whether or not it had anything to do with the plot of the opera. Usually it didn't, but it gave the Jockey Club, a group of wealthy subscribers, a chance to look over their favorite beautiful ladies of the ballet at a convenient time of the evening, and these patrons were attentively in their seats for the ballet, if not for the rest of the opera. The tradition of the third act divertissement was so firmly established that when Wagner put his Venusburg ballet at the very beginning of Act I of Tannhäuser, there were such forcible protests by the Jockey Club that the whole opera was nearly withdrawn.
Fortunately for us, Verdi was less revolutionary about Parisian conventions and composed many third-act opera ballets. Although seldom included in today’s productions, they contain some of the most delightful dance music of the period. For I Vespri Siciliani, he devised a ballet called The Four Seasons. His libretto called for Janus, the God of New Year, to inaugurate a series of dances by each of the seasons in turn. Verdi’s notes suggest such notions as ballerinas warming themselves in Winter by dancing, Spring bringing on warm breezes, indolent Summer ladies being surprised by an Autumnal faun, etc. The present ballet follows his general plan. The original score is augmented by a few selections of his ballet music from I Lombardi and Il Trovatore.

The score for this ballet was commissioned by George Balanchine from Paul Hindemith in 1940. The ballet, together with Ravel’s opera L’Enfant et les Sortilèges, constituted the opening program of Ballet Society (the direct predecessor of the New York City Ballet) on November 20, 1946. In Complete Stories of the Great Ballets, Balanchine wrote of the ballet that it “is an expression in dance and music of the ancient notion that the human organism is made up of four different humors, or temperaments. Each one of us possesses these four humors, but in different degrees, and it is from the dominance of one of them that the four physical and psychological types — melancholic, sanguinic, phlegmatic, and choleric — were derived …. Although the score is based on this idea of the four temperaments, neither the music nor the ballet itself makes specific or literal interpretation of the idea. An understanding of the Greek and medieval notion of the temperaments was merely the point of departure for both composer and choreographer.”An accomplished pianist, Balanchine commissioned the score because he wanted a short work he could play at home with friends during his evening musicales. It was completed in 1940 and had its first public performance at a 1944 concert with Lukas Foss as the pianist.","George Balanchine","32 minutes","Theme with Four Variations [According to the Four Temperaments], for string orchestra and piano (1940)Commissioned by George Balanchine","Paul Hindemith","November 20, 1946, Ballet Society, Central High School of Needle Trades, New York","Beatrice Tompkins, José Martinez, Elise Reiman, Lew Christensen, Gisella Caccialanza, Francisco Moncion, William Dollar, Georgia Hiden, Rita Karlin, Mary Ellen Moylan, Fred Danieli, Todd Bolender, Tanaquil Le Clercq",13,"-","-","-","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_center,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1604271035/Ballets/Four-Temperaments-The/FourTemperaments-c43158-14?_a=AACnOEz,","November 20, 1946","Ballet Society, Central High School of Needle Trades, New York"

The success of the first series caused a second (Opus 65) to be created in 1874, utilizing some materials which were left over from the original set. Balanchine used the entire two sections, and the atmosphere reflects the social dance of Vienna during the mid-century. There is a difference in mood between Opus 52 and Opus 65, with the former being more intimate and domestic, and the latter more theatrical.
The dancers and musicians are all dressed in period ballroom costumes, and during the first set of 18 waltzes, the four couples dance in interweaving combinations in an intimate, elegantly appointed ballroom, with the women wearing dancing slippers. After a brief lowering of the curtain, the couples return to dance the second set of 14 waltzes, with the women now wearing ballet dresses and pointe shoes. They then leave the stage and return in the original costumes and pause to listen to the final waltz set to Goethe’s words: “Now, Muses, enough! You try in vain to portray how misery and happiness alternate in a loving heart!” Of Liebeslieder Walzer, Balanchine said, “In the first act, it is the real people who are dancing. In the second act, it is their souls.”","George Balanchine","53 minutes","Liebeslieder, Op. 52, 1869; Neue Liebeslieder, Op. 65, 1874, waltzes for piano duet and vocal quartet, all set to poems by Friedrich Daumer, except last, by Goethe","Johannes Brahms","November 22, 1960, New York City Ballet, City Center of Music and Drama","Diana Adams, Bill Carter, Melissa Hayden, Jonathan Watts, Jillana, Conrad Ludlow, Violette Verdy, Nicholas Magallanes",8,"Karinska","David Hays","David Hays","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1579693679/legacy/imported/liebeslieder-walzer-key?_a=AACnOEz,","November 22, 1960","New York City Ballet, City Center of Music and Drama"

Balanchine was no stranger to opera. Not only did he create ballets to the music from such works as La Sonnambula and Don Sebastian, he also choreographed the ballet portions of many opera productions. He felt that opera taught something important. ""From Verdi's way of dealing with the chorus,"" Balanchine told biographer Bernard Taper, ""I have learned how to handle the corps de ballet, the ensemble, the soloists, how to make the soloists stand out against the corps, and when to give them a rest.""
Ballo della Regina is a virtuoso set of variations, comparable to the bel canto style of opera. It is set to ballet music that was cut from the original production of Verdi's Don Carlo. Lincoln Kirstein writes that the ballet seems to take place in a grotto, with reference through lighting and costumes to the original tale of a fisherman's search for the perfect pearl.","George Balanchine","17 minutes","Don Carlos, Act III (1867)","Giuseppe Verdi","January 12, 1978, New York City Ballet, New York State Theater","Merrill Ashley, Robert Weiss, Debra Austin, Bonita Borne, Stephanie Saland, Sheryl Ware",6,"Ben Benson","-","Ronald Bates","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1594332253/Ballets/Ballo-Della-Regina/c41590-7_Ballo_TPeck_sRGB?_a=AACnOEz,","January 12, 1978","New York City Ballet, New York State Theater"

Peter Martins’ Hallelujah Junction is set to a score of the same name by John Adams.  The music was written for two pianos, and named after a small truck stop near the California-Nevada border. Adams said of the piece, “It was a case of a good title needing a piece, so I obliged by composing this work for two pianos.” The work centers on delayed repetition between the two pianos, creating an effect of echoing sonorities. There is a constant shift of pulse and meter, but the main rhythms are based on the rhythms of the word “Hal-le-LU-jah.”  The ballet, originally created for the Royal Danish Ballet, features a principal couple in white, a male soloist in black, and a small corps de ballet.

Wheeldon’s ballet features a cast of nearly 50 dancers and tells the story of a young boy, Oliver Pendleton Percy the Third, who falls asleep in New York’s American Museum of Natural History, and dreams that the people in his life — family members, teachers, classmates — have all been transformed into animals.

For the original production of Swan Lake in Moscow in 1877, Tschaikovsky composed a pas de deux for Act III at the request of Anna Sobeshchanskaya, a Bolshoi prima ballerina who was one of the first dancers to perform the lead role. Since it was composed later than the rest of the music, it was not included in the published score and was therefore not available to Marius Petipa when he choreographed his famous Swan Lake in St. Petersburg, in 1895. In its place, Petipa moved some music from Act I to Act III, and it is this piece that is now well-known as the Black Swan pas de deux. Well over half a century later, the complete and original Swan Lake score was found, including an appendix with the lost pas de deux. Hearing of its historic discovery, George Balanchine asked for — and was granted — permission to use it for his own choreography. The result is an eight-minute display of ballet bravura and technique.","George Balanchine","9 minutes","Excerpt from Swan Lake, Op. 20, Act III (1877)","Peter Ilyitch Tschaikovsky","March 29, 1960, New York City Ballet, City Center of Music and Drama","Violette Verdy, Conrad Ludlow",2,"Karinska","-","Jack Owen Brown, subsequently by David Hays (original production); Mark Stanley (current production)","https://res.cloudinary.com/new-york-city-ballet/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_700,w_800/f_auto/q_auto/v1579690653/legacy/imported/tschai-pas-key?_a=AACnOEz,","March 29, 1960","New York City Ballet, City Center of Music and Drama"
